# CUDA Beam Search Implementation

This document provides a detailed overview of the CUDA-accelerated beam search implementation, including both standard and diverse beam search algorithms.

## Overview

The implementation is based on the Hugging Face Transformers library's beam search algorithm, optimized for CUDA acceleration. It includes several performance optimizations and features to improve generation quality.

## Algorithm Description

### Standard Beam Search

The standard beam search implementation includes the following key features:

1. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Grid-stride loop pattern for efficient parallel processing
   - Shared memory usage for faster data access
   - Memory coalescing for efficient memory access patterns
   - Efficient thread block configuration

2. **Scoring and Selection**:
   - Temperature scaling for logits
   - Length penalty for sequence normalization
   - Early stopping support
   - Memory-efficient beam pruning

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Shared memory buffers for intermediate results
   - Memory coalescing hints for better memory access patterns
   - Efficient tensor operations
   - Optimized shared memory allocation

### Diverse Beam Search

The diverse beam search extends the standard implementation with:

1. **Group-based Processing**:
   - Division of beams into groups
   - Parallel processing of beam groups
   - Configurable diversity penalties
   - Efficient group synchronization

2. **Diversity Mechanisms**:
   - Inter-group diversity penalties
   - Temperature scaling per group
   - Length normalization with group awareness
   - Group-specific scoring

3. **Memory Optimizations**:
   - Shared memory for group scores
   - Efficient group-to-group communication
   - Memory-efficient diversity calculations
   - Optimized shared memory layout

## CUDA Kernel Design

### Standard Beam Search Kernel

```cpp
__global__ void process_beam_search_kernel(
    const int64_t* input_ids,
    const float* next_scores,
    const int64_t* next_tokens,
    const int64_t* next_indices,
    float* next_beam_scores,
    int64_t* next_beam_tokens,
    int64_t* next_beam_indices,
    const int batch_size,
    const int num_beams,
    const int vocab_size,
    const int pad_token_id,
    const int eos_token_id,
    const float length_penalty,
    const float temperature
)
```

Key features:
- Shared memory for intermediate scores
