# CUDA Beam Search Implementation Details

## Overview

This document describes the implementation details of the CUDA-accelerated beam search algorithm. The implementation is based on the Hugging Face Transformers library's beam search, optimized for GPU execution.

## Algorithm Description

Beam search is a heuristic search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising nodes in a limited set. In the context of language models, it's used to generate sequences by maintaining a fixed number of partial sequences (beams) and expanding them with the most likely next tokens.

### Key Components

1. **Beam Search Scorer**: Manages the beam search process, including:
   - Maintaining beam hypotheses
   - Scoring and selecting the best tokens
   - Handling early stopping and length penalties

2. **CUDA Kernel**: Implements the core beam search logic on the GPU:
   - Parallel processing of multiple beams
   - Efficient scoring and selection of tokens
   - Memory-efficient data structures

## Implementation Details

### CUDA Kernel Design

The CUDA implementation uses a grid-stride loop pattern for efficient parallel processing:

```cpp
__global__ void process_beam_search_kernel(
    const int64_t* input_ids,
    const float* next_scores,
    const int64_t* next_tokens,
    const int64_t* next_indices,
    float* next_beam_scores,
    int64_t* next_beam_tokens,
    int64_t* next_beam_indices,
    const int batch_size,
    const int num_beams,
    const int vocab_size,
    const int pad_token_id,
    const int eos_token_id
)
```

Key features of the kernel:
- One thread per beam
- Shared memory for temporary storage
- Efficient memory access patterns
- Atomic operations for thread synchronization

### Memory Management

The implementation uses several memory optimization techniques:
1. **Contiguous Memory Layout**: All tensors are stored in contiguous memory for efficient access
2. **Shared Memory**: Temporary storage for beam scores and tokens
3. **Coalesced Memory Access**: Threads access memory in a way that maximizes memory bandwidth

### Performance Considerations

1. **Grid and Block Sizing**:
   - Grid size = batch size
   - Block size = number of beams
   - Optimized for typical use cases (batch_size <= 32, num_beams <= 8)

2. **Memory Access Patterns**:
   - Coalesced memory access for input tensors
   - Efficient shared memory usage for intermediate results
   - Minimized global memory access

3. **Thread Synchronization**:
   - Minimal synchronization points
   - Efficient use of atomic operations
   - Careful handling of race conditions

## Usage Example

```python
from cuda_beam_search import CUDABeamSearchScorer

# Initialize the scorer
scorer = CUDABeamSearchScorer(
    batch_size=2,
    num_beams=3,
    device=torch.device("cuda"),
    length_penalty=1.0,
    do_early_stopping=False,
    num_beam_hyps_to_keep=1
)

# Process one step
next_beam_scores, next_beam_tokens, next_beam_indices = scorer.process(
    input_ids=input_ids,
    next_scores=next_scores,
    next_tokens=next_tokens,
    next_indices=next_indices,
    pad_token_id=0,
    eos_token_id=1
)
```

## Performance Optimization

The implementation includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Memory Layout Optimization**:
   - Contiguous memory access patterns
   - Efficient use of shared memory
   - Minimized global memory access

2. **Thread Utilization**:
   - Optimal grid and block sizing
   - Efficient thread synchronization
   - Minimized thread divergence

3. **Algorithmic Optimizations**:
   - Early stopping for completed beams
   - Efficient scoring and selection
   - Memory-efficient data structures

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future optimization:
1. Support for larger batch sizes and number of beams
2. Implementation of additional beam search variants
3. Further memory optimization
4. Support for mixed precision computation
