# Diverse Beam Search Implementation Details

## Overview

This document describes the implementation details of the CUDA-accelerated diverse beam search algorithm. The implementation is based on the Hugging Face Transformers library's diverse beam search, optimized for GPU execution.

## Algorithm Description

Diverse beam search is an extension of standard beam search that promotes diversity among the generated sequences. It achieves this by:

1. Dividing the beams into groups
2. Applying a diversity penalty to tokens that have been selected by previous groups
3. Selecting the best tokens for each group while considering both the original scores and the diversity penalty

### Key Components

1. **Diverse Beam Search Scorer**: Manages the diverse beam search process, including:
   - Maintaining separate beam hypotheses for each group
   - Applying diversity penalties to promote token diversity
   - Handling early stopping and length penalties

2. **CUDA Kernel**: Implements the core diverse beam search logic on the GPU:
   - Parallel processing of multiple beam groups
   - Efficient diversity penalty application
   - Memory-efficient data structures

## Implementation Details

### CUDA Kernel Design

The CUDA implementation uses a grid-stride loop pattern for efficient parallel processing:

```cpp
__global__ void process_diverse_beam_search_kernel(
    const int64_t* input_ids,
    const float* next_scores,
    const int64_t* next_tokens,
    const int64_t* next_indices,
    float* next_beam_scores,
    int64_t* next_beam_tokens,
    int64_t* next_beam_indices,
    const int batch_size,
    const int num_beams,
    const int num_beam_groups,
    const int vocab_size,
    const int pad_token_id,
    const int eos_token_id,
    const float diversity_penalty
)
```

Key features of the kernel:
- One thread per beam within each group
- Shared memory for temporary storage
- Efficient diversity penalty application
- Atomic operations for thread synchronization

### Memory Management

The implementation uses several memory optimization techniques:
1. **Contiguous Memory Layout**: All tensors are stored in contiguous memory for efficient access
2. **Shared Memory**: Temporary storage for beam scores and tokens
3. **Coalesced Memory Access**: Threads access memory in a way that maximizes memory bandwidth

### Performance Considerations

1. **Grid and Block Sizing**:
   - Grid size = (batch_size, num_beam_groups)
   - Block size = group_size (num_beams / num_beam_groups)
   - Optimized for typical use cases (batch_size <= 32, num_beam_groups <= 4)

2. **Memory Access Patterns**:
   - Coalesced memory access for input tensors
   - Efficient shared memory usage for intermediate results
   - Minimized global memory access

3. **Thread Synchronization**:
   - Minimal synchronization points
   - Efficient use of atomic operations
   - Careful handling of race conditions

## Usage Example

```python
from cuda_beam_search.diverse import CUDADiverseBeamSearchScorer

# Initialize the scorer
scorer = CUDADiverseBeamSearchScorer(
    batch_size=2,
    num_beams=6,  # Must be divisible by num_beam_groups
    num_beam_groups=2,
    device=torch.device("cuda"),
    length_penalty=1.0,
    do_early_stopping=False,
    num_beam_hyps_to_keep=1,
    diversity_penalty=0.5  # Controls the strength of diversity
)

# Process one step
next_beam_scores, next_beam_tokens, next_beam_indices = scorer.process(
    input_ids=input_ids,
    next_scores=next_scores,
    next_tokens=next_tokens,
    next_indices=next_indices,
    pad_token_id=0,
    eos_token_id=1
)
```

## Performance Optimization

The implementation includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Memory Layout Optimization**:
   - Contiguous memory access patterns
   - Efficient use of shared memory
   - Minimized global memory access

2. **Thread Utilization**:
   - Optimal grid and block sizing
   - Efficient thread synchronization
   - Minimized thread divergence

3. **Algorithmic Optimizations**:
   - Early stopping for completed beams
   - Efficient diversity penalty application
   - Memory-efficient data structures

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future optimization:
1. Support for larger batch sizes and number of beam groups
2. Implementation of additional diversity metrics
3. Further memory optimization
4. Support for mixed precision computation
5. Dynamic adjustment of diversity penalty
