# Diverse Beam Search Implementation

This document provides a detailed overview of the CUDA-accelerated diverse beam search implementation, which extends the standard beam search algorithm with group-based processing and diversity mechanisms.

## Overview

The diverse beam search implementation divides the beams into groups and applies diversity penalties between groups to encourage different generation paths. This helps to generate more diverse and interesting outputs.

## Algorithm Description

### Group-based Processing

1. **Beam Grouping**:
   - Division of beams into equal-sized groups
   - Parallel processing of beam groups
   - Group-specific scoring and selection
   - Efficient group synchronization

2. **Diversity Mechanisms**:
   - Inter-group diversity penalties
   - Temperature scaling per group
   - Length normalization with group awareness
   - Group-specific scoring

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Shared memory for group scores
   - Efficient group-to-group communication
   - Memory-efficient diversity calculations
   - Optimized shared memory layout

## CUDA Kernel Design

```cpp
__global__ void process_diverse_beam_search_kernel(
    const int64_t* input_ids,
    const float* next_scores,
    const int64_t* next_tokens,
    const int64_t* next_indices,
    float* next_beam_scores,
    int64_t* next_beam_tokens,
    int64_t* next_beam_indices,
    const int batch_size,
    const int num_beams,
    const int num_beam_groups,
    const int vocab_size,
    const int pad_token_id,
    const int eos_token_id,
    const float diversity_penalty,
    const float length_penalty,
    const float temperature
)
```

Key features:
- Group-based processing
- Shared memory for group scores
- Diversity penalty application
- Temperature scaling per group
- Length penalty with group awareness
- Efficient group synchronization

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management

1. **Shared Memory Usage**:
   - Group scores stored in shared memory

   - Optimized shared memory layout

2. **Memory Access Patterns**:
   - Coalesced memory access
   - Efficient tensor operations
   - Minimized memory transfers
   - Optimized memory layout

### Parallel Processing

1. **Grid Configuration**:
   - 2D grid (batch x groups)
   - Optimal block size calculation

```python
from cuda_beam_search import CUDADiverseBeamSearchScorer
import torch

# Initialize the scorer
scorer = CUDADiverseBeamSearchScorer(
    batch_size=4,
    num_beams=6,
    num_beam_groups=3,
    device=torch.device("cuda"),
    diversity_penalty=0.5,  # Optional: diversity penalty
    length_penalty=1.0,     # Optional: length normalization
    temperature=1.0,        # Optional: temperature scaling
    early_stopping=True,    # Optional: enable early stopping
    max_steps=100           # Optional: maximum generation steps
)

# Process a step
next_beam_scores, next_beam_tokens, next_beam_indices = scorer.process(
    input_ids,
    next_scores,
    next_tokens,
    next_indices,
    pad_token_id,
    eos_token_id
)
```
